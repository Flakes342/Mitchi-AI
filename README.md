**Your Local AI Productivity Agent**  
Mitchi AI is a **local-first, privacy-respecting AI assistant** that sits on your machine like a chill, command-reactive cat. Built as a modular, extensible desktop agent, Mitchi can connect to your favorite tools (Gmail, GitHub, Reddit, Weather, Shell, etc.) and perform intelligent actions on your command using LLMs â€” but it never does anything behind your back


---

## Overview

---
Mitchi comes with a suite of both internal and external tools:

### Internal Tools
- Shell command execution
- Local file reading and summarization
- Web scraping and summarization
- Memory manager (note, recall, update)
- Local goal/task management

### External Tools (OAuth-enabled)
- Gmail: Read, send, summarize, manage emails
- GitHub: View PRs, issues, notifications
- Reddit: Fetch and summarize threads, sentiment detection
- AccuWeather: Get current weather and forecasts
- Google Maps: Location search and basic directions
- CoinGecko: Crypto price tracking
- Calendar & Notion: Scheduling and knowledge access

Each external integration requires explicit user login via OAuth. Mitchi never accesses anything without permission.
